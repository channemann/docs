# Phase 0: General Setup

The setup process is broken into two parts: [configuring the Raspberry Pi](rpi.md) and [installing the openaps tools and dependencies](openaps.md). After completing these steps, you will be able to use the openaps tools to communicate with your insulin pump and CGM.

At this stage, you may want to begin documenting each step that you take. This will help in two ways: 

First, this enables you to better ask for assistance if you run into errors, bugs, etc. By explaining where you are in the documentation and what you're seeing (by copying and pasting your last command and the output), someone can better provide tips on what you should consider next. 

Second, this will enable you to help us improve our documentation. Did we skip a step, or not explain clearly? After you get through the setup instructions, you should consider forking a copy of these docs, editing with any changes you think should be made, and submitting a pull request (PR) back to the master. Others will be able to review & discuss any edits, make further changes, and pull this edits into the main file. This helps us all "pay it forward" as we go!
 
### Outline of Phase 0

* Upon Completion
    * Have collected some of your own baseline data to use for future analysis 
    * Have gone through the setup process and be able to help others do the same
    * Possess hardware and software tools necessary to build an OpenAPS implementation


* Phase Tasks
    * Store at least 30 days of CGM data and/or a recent A1c 
    * Procure hardware 
    * Download and install software and tools
    * Test a subset of tools to make sure they work as expected
    

* Community Contribution
    * Provide feedback on ...
        * Hardware procurement (cheap deals, alternatives)
        * Difficulties with installation process (‘this looked different on my system” or “I couldn’t locate that menu” or “I ran into this error”)
        * Solutions to overcome setup difficulties, especially for systems that are not yet covered (some different flavor of Linux, for example)
    * Help edit setup instructions for accuracy, coverage, ease of understanding

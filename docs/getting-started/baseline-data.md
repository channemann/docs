#Baseline data

##CGM Data

Before getting started, we ask you to store at least 30 days of CGM data. For now, the easiest way to do that is to upload your Dexcom receiver to Dexcom Studio. (Or if you use a Medtronic CGM, upload your CGM data to Carelink). We suggest you get in a habit of doing this regularly, so you have ongoing data to show trends in your overall estimated average glucose (eAG, a good indicator in trends in a1c) and variations in your "time in range".

##Recent A1c

Go ahead and document your most recent a1c and keep it somewhere handy, so you can keep track of it in the future and/or be able to share it if you choose once there is a request from OpenAPS researchers who may aggregate anonymous data to show what happens when people use OpenAPS.

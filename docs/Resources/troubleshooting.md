# Troubleshooting

Even those who follow this documentation precisely are bound to end up stuck at some point. This could be due to something unique to your system, a mistyped command, actions performed out of order, or even a typo in this guide. This section provides some tools to help diagnose the issue as well as some common errors that have been experienced and resolved before.

## Useful linux commands

More comprehensive command line references can be found [here](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2598082/linux/linux-linux-command-line-cheat-sheet.html) and [here](http://www.pixelbeat.org/cmdline.html).

`$ ls -alt`

`$ cd`

`$ pwd`

`$ sudo <command>`

`$ tail -f /var/log/syslog`

`$ df -h`

`$ ifconfig`

`$ cat <filename>`

`$ nano <filename>`

`$ stat <filename>`

`$ pip freeze`

`$ sudo reboot`

`$ sudo shutdown -h now`

The correct way to shut down the Raspberry Pi from the command line. Wait for the green light to stop blinking before removing the power supply.

`$ dmesg`

Displayss all the kernel output since boot. Itâ€™s pretty difficult to read, but sometimes you see things in there about the wifi getting disconnected and so forth.

`uptime`

[add something for decocare raw logging]

## CareLink USB Stick

The `model` command is a quick way to verify whether you can communicate with the pump. Test this with `$ openaps use <my_pump_name> model`.

If you can't get a response, it may be a range issue. The range of the CareLink radio is not particularly good, and orientation matters; see [range testing report](https://gist.github.com/channemann/0ff376e350d94ccc9f00) for more information.

If you still can't get a response, trying unplugging and replugging the CareLink stick.

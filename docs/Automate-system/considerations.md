# Phase 3: Automate Your System

Phase 3 focuses on creating a schedule to automate the manual system you developed in [Phase 2](). Again, at this stage testing is critical and output of the system should be tracked and validated over a series of time, and include thorough edge case testing.

At this stage, you should have a suitable algorithm to manually recommend necessary changes to basal rates that you have tested thoroughly. That was essentially a practice closed-loop system, with you completing the loop by manually calculating what you would do in that scenario. Now, you're ready to automate your loop. This section focuses on [creating a schedule](create-schedule.md) to collect data from the pump and cgm, calculate IOB and a temp basal suggestion, and then enact that on the pump. Again, at this stage testing is critical and output of the system should be tracked and [validated](validate-output.md) over a series of time, and include thorough edge case testing to ensure that the loop is working, the schedule is as designed, and that you can quick-check when the system is running and trouble shoot any runtime challenges.





	* Upon Completion
		* Have a schedule to run a set of algorithms designed to keep blood glucose in target range with temp basals
		* Have repeatedly validated the output of your scheduled work  and understand how to quick-check whether the system is running and what the current outputs are, plus trouble shoot any runtime challenges.

	* Phase Tasks
		* Create schedule to collect & validate input data, calculate IOB, generate temp basal suggestion, prepare to enact (utilizing crontab)
		* Carefully analyze output and outcomes from the scheduled system over a series of time
		* Test at least these cases: data corruption, lack of data, lack of connectivity, and other non-ideal operating conditions

	* Community Contributions
		* Provide feedback on efficacy of algorithms
		* Help edit instructions for Phase 3
		* Provide results of testing (including start date for first overnight evaluation, please share with Dana) for comparing and contrasting with others
		* Summarize research findings and synthesize them into jump-off points for others' research

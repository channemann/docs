# Troubleshooting

Even those who follow this documentation precisely are bound to end up stuck at some point.

This section provides some tools to help diagnose the issue as well as some common errors that have been experienced and resolved before.

## Useful linux commands

`$ ls -alt`

`$ cd`

`$ tail -f /var/log/syslog`

`$ df -h`

`$ ifconfig`

`$ cat <filename>`

`$ stat <filename>`

`uptime`
